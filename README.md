# Spa React (Webpack)

A full featured starter for modern front-end single page applications. Uses React and ***Webpack 4*** to create optimized builds, ***linters*** to check for code style and errors, ***W3C HTML*** and ***A11Y*** validation, and finally easily deployed using ***Firebase***.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing and deployment.

### Prerequisites

Node and NPM versions used for this project

```
node >= 10.0.0
npm >= 5.6.0
```

### Installing

After cloning the repository, run following from root directory of cloned project

```
npm install
```

### Additional setup

In order to deploy the app, a ```.env``` file should be created in the root directory of the project. The deploy script ```npm run deploy``` will read this file to determine what Firebase project to update.

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT=<YOUR-FIREBASE-PROJECT-HERE>
```

To get the project name, visit https://console.firebase.google.com and create a new project. The project name created here will be used in the ```.env``` file mentioned above.

### NPM Commands


```npm run start```
- spawns a hot reloadable dev server and browser instance of the app.

```npm run test```
- runs dev tests once then exits

```npm run build```
- creates production build to build/

```npm run deploy```
- creates production build to build/, and prompts to deploy to Firebase
